**GradeCalculator Program**

Summary
Based on the student's score and the maximum allowable score, this Java application determines and shows the student's grade. There are two classes in the program:

**Main**: Manages user-provided scores and shows the grade that has been determined.
**GradeCalculator**: Provides the reasoning for determining the grade as a percentage.
